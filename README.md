# AFK: An E-Commerce website for gaming laptops and accessories

## Overview
Years ago, I was looking to buy a gaming laptop as my MacBook Air could not handle most of my favorite games. Upon searching, I settled for a customized Alienware laptop that I use to this day, and it performs beautifully with demanding games like Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2.

I really liked the way the Dell website allowed me to customize each component of my laptop such as the graphic card, processor, and more. Thus, when I was thinking of ideas for an e-commerce website for my portfolio, I wanted to make something similar.

AFK is a portfolio project built in NextJS to simulate an E-Commerce website. Even though it uses Stripe to simulate a real payment experience, this project does not sell real products.
